About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University with research interests in Transportation Systems, Retail Operations, Marketing Analytics and Data Science. Currently, I am working on a project on Demand Management in Last-Mile Delivery Operations under the supervision of dr. Niels Agatz, dr. Luuk Veelenturf, and dr. Robert Rooderkerk.

Research Interests

My primary research interests are in the fields of:

Transportation Systems
Retail Operations
Marketing Analytics
Data Science

Current Project
In delivery and service operations, the service provider and customer must agree on a day or time window for the service. These agreements directly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations, as well as the attractiveness for the customer. In our specific problem customers have a subscription for an at home service with a service provider (e.g. for periodic maintenance). Each period the service provider must agree with its customers when to exactly carry out the service.  As we know the customers subscribed to the service, we want to investigate the use of fixed a-priori routes, to simplify planning both during and after the order intake. Based on these a-priori routes timeslot options can be offered to the customers, without any re-optimization being necessary. We specifically investigate under which circumstances this simpler “milk-man” route approaches perform well in comparison with the more complex dynamic approaches.We investigate two conceptual models for designing a priori routes. In the first, customers select a day and the timeslot will be announced after the day is fully booked. In the second, customers are clustered in the a-priori routes in more detail such that they can chose from different day-timeslot combinations.
